# Unified AltGr (Alt+Ctrl) APL keyboard
Build using [MSKLC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx), which works fine on Windows 10, despite its documentation.

## Note about the UK layout
As opposed to the US layout, the UK one loses the standard AltGr combos. Acute accented vowels are available with AltGr+Shift+A,Vowel and Euro sign is available with AltGr+Shift+Y,UppercaseE and broken stile is available with ALtGr+Shift+R,UnbrokenStile.
