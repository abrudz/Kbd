# ASCII symbol compositions
Not every symbols has a meaning in any or every APL implementation or dialect. Some symbols have different meanings in different implementations and dialects. The following are listed with their Dyalog meanings (in `⎕ML←1`) and some [extensions](https://github.com/abrudz/dyalog-apl-extended).

Not every APL symbol is included in every keyboard layout. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/abrudz/Kbd/issues/new) if you would like to request a symbol to be included.

Some compositions are commutative (ASCII symbols can be entered in either order), but some must be entered in the order given (such as left tack and right tack ⊣ ⊢).

## macOS
\**Not the Greek or Latin group symbols*, possibly has "APL Function Symbol" in the Unicode name.

Press alt and the 1st symbol together followed by the 2nd symbol. For example, <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;</kbd> then <kbd>-</kbd> gives `←` .
